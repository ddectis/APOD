NASA provides a number of free APIs (https://api.nasa.gov/). This project is an implementation of the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API. One of the ways you can call the API is to ask for a random picture

# How to Use
It's relatively straight forward to use. Place all 3 files in the same directory and then browse to index.html. Index.js fetches the APOD request URL
